* [ ] Signal Processing
    * [ ] Convert analog microphone signal to digital _n_-bit signal
        * Starts off at 10, but increasing sample rate might drop resolution
    * [ ] Apply FHT to "bin" the wavelengths
        * 10 bins?
    * [ ] Increase sample rate on Arduino from 9.6KHz to >= 20KHz
* [ ] LEDs
    * [x] Light up LEDs based on analog signal amplitude
        * [x] Add a "hat" that decays over time
    * [ ] Section LED strand
* [ ] Learning
    * [ ] Add decay-per-wavelength
    * [ ] Visualize "novelty"
        * [ ] Detect patterns in sound
            * [ ] ???
        * [ ] Make brightness & novelty proportionate
